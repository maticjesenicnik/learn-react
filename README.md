## How to Run

Each project can be run individually using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. If the project has a backend, navigate to the `backend` folder (if applicable), run `npm install`, and then start the server with `node app.js`. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
4. Use `npm run dev` to launch the development server for the frontend.

Ensure that both the frontend and backend are running for projects that require it.
